                <p>I believe <em>Information Technology</em> is a great platform to give individuals power and knowledge that's able to transcend and simplify lives.</p>
                <p>In the past 3 years, I have helped creative marketing teams, businesses, and startups with web development and design.</p>
                <p>Before 2016, I worked in the medical field assisting operating room teams save lives. I have a natural empathy towards people and want to have a positive impact anyway I can.</p>
                <p>Aside from work - I like music, airplanes, animals, the ocean, and family. I'm an INFJ - creative, gentle, and caring.</p>
                <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
